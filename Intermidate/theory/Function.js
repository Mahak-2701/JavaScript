// A function declaration looks like this:

// function name(parameters, delimited, by, comma) {
//   /* code */
// }
// Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables.
// A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the 
// function doesn’t see its local variables.
// A function can return a value. If it doesn’t, then its result is undefined.
// To make the code clean and easy to understand, it’s recommended to use mainly local variables and 

// parameters in the function, not outer variables.

// It is always easier to understand a function which gets parameters, works with them and returns a result than a function which gets no parameters, but modifies outer variables as a side effect.

// Function naming:

// A name should clearly describe what the function does. When we see a function call in the code, 

// a good name instantly gives us an understanding what it does and returns.
// A function is an action, so function names are usually verbal.
// There exist many well-known function prefixes like create…, show…, get…, check… and so on. 
// Use them to hint what a function does.
// Functions are the main building blocks of scripts. Now we’ve covered the basics,
//  so we actually can start creating and using them. But that’s only the beginning of the path.
//   We are going to return to them many times, going more deeply into their advanced features
